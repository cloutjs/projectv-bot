Project V is a german Valorant tournament website from Riot Games for everyone, from noobs to pros! I have made a little bot with which you can get some information about users and teams.

These are the commands:<br>
$info [user] - get info about an user<br>
$teaminfo [team name] - get info about a team<br>

If you use the source, please credit me. Thanks :)
